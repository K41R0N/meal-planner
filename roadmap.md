# Meal Planner App Roadmap

- I'm only allowed to have one main meal for lunch, dinner is always a soup, and breakfast is always a smoothie. Do not suggest recipes that don't follow this structure. If it's not a smoothie, a vinaigrette or a soup, it's always a meal

- I want to deploy this project on Netlify, no external APIs. Maybe a search algorithm, or a way to use an LLM chatbot to get dynamic suggestions on recipes based on my intention (I'm traveling for a week and need something simple but nutritious, I'm looking to lose 5 pounds in the next month)

- Eventually, I will need a macro counter to make sure I'm getting a balanced diet with my recipes, but this should come at a later stage.

- I want this app to be mobile native, so responsive design is a must.

- I want to eventually add a price tracking functionality for the ingredients, so I could also categorize on how to make the most nutritious yet cheapest meals, this will require my manual input when I'm shopping for the ingredients.

- I would like to add special tags to the recipes like (quick, meal-prep friendly, superfood, high in protein, etc) This would make navigation and the search function quite a lot more useful.

- Another stretch goal would be to add a localization function to the app so it displays the recipe in any language based on user input

## Phase 1: Data Structure Setup
1. **Recipe Taxonomy**
   - Create JSON data structure for recipes:
   ```javascript
   {
     "id": "unique-id",
     "name": "Recipe Name",
     "type": "smoothie|main|soup",
     "meal_time": "breakfast|lunch|dinner",
     "ingredients": [
       { "name": "ingredient", "quantity": "1/2 cup", "category": "oils" }
     ],
     "instructions": ["step 1", "step 2"],
     "servings": 4
   }
   ```
   
2. **Ingredient Database**
   - Convert shopping list to JSON:
   ```javascript
   {
     "name": "Coconut Oil",
     "category": "oils",
     "purchase_frequency": "monthly",
     "typical_quantity": "500ml jar"
   }
   ```

## Phase 2: Core Features
1. **Daily Meal Framework**
   - Fixed structure:
   ```javascript
   const dailyTemplate = {
     breakfast: { type: "smoothie", options: 3 },
     lunch: { type: "main", options: 5 },
     dinner: { type: "soup", options: 2 }
   }
   ```

2. **Weekly Planner Engine**
   - Algorithm requirements:
   - No repeated recipes within 3 days
   - Check ingredient availability
   - Generate shopping list based on selections

## Phase 3: Tech Stack
**Core Stack:**
- HTML/CSS/JS (Vanilla)
- Parcel (Zero-config bundler)
- Netlify (Static site hosting)
- LocalStorage (User preferences)

**Mobile-First Approach:**
- CSS Grid/Flexbox for layouts
- PWA capabilities for app-like feel
- Touch-optimized UI components

**Future-Proofing:**
- JAMstack architecture
- i18n localization support
- Price tracking schema
- Nutrition database structure

## Phase 4: Development Milestones
### Immediate Priorities (Month 1)
1. Week 1: Data Preparation
   - Add recipe tags: quick, meal-prep, superfood, high-protein
   - Implement basic search filters

2. Week 2: Basic Functionality
   - Responsive recipe cards
   - Mobile-friendly meal grid

3. Week 3: Advanced Features
   - Shopping list price logger (CSV export)

### Medium-Term Goals (Month 2-3)
1. Intelligent Suggestions
   - Rule-based search algorithm
   - LLM integration (local plugin architecture)
   - Travel-friendly meal filters

2. Nutrition System
   - Macro counter foundation
   - USDA nutrition data mapping

### Long-Term Vision
1. Recipe Scaling:
   - Budget optimizer (price/quantity/nutrition ratio)

2. Dietary Tracking:
   - Weight loss/gain planner
   - Auto-generated meal plans

3. Integration:
   - Multi-language support (i18n)
   - Offline-first capabilities
   - Cross-device sync

## Security & Privacy
- All data stays local by default
- Optional Netlify Identity for cloud sync
- Data validation/sanitization for manual inputs

## Future Expansion
4. Localization Features:
   - Recipe language switcher
   - Measurement system converter
   - Regional ingredient substitutions

5. Price Tracking:
   - Manual price entry UI
   - Historical price charts
   - Budget meal suggestions

**Immediate Next Steps:**
4. Create sample recipe JSON with new tags
5. Set up Netlify project structure
6. Implement basic responsive layout

The system is designed to:
- Maintain your strict meal program structure
- Allow controlled expansion through the data files
- Prevent recipe repetition while ensuring nutritional variety
- Generate accurate shopping lists based on weekly plans
